getCore


GoCore
- need to delete the buildXXXApp? and commit most likely because only me and dan could ever run the build tool with the private repo

need to build npm hash and resolver for start_app

-- have go watch write a hash on each file change.  write a .goCore file in root of app with local last change, write to this first so it matches or just dont automate the npm install with goWatch.

- need to look at all the other dependencies like production build and run it if its never been run on start_app

- in theory we can build a directory hash of vendorPackages and report on what is different and tell the user or possibly partially re-install folders which the hash is different
