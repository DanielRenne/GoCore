# GoCore

A Golang solution of tools for building a full stack web application.

## Goals of the Project ##

Below are some targeted goals:

* Http & Https Redirection & HTTP 2.0 with Golang 1.6 and [gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* Extension packages for common functions including:
	* File IO Management & Manipulation
	* Zip File Compression & Decompression 

----------

* Database extensions and drivers for the following:
	* Supported databases:
		* SQLite3
		* MySQL
		* Microsoft SQLServer
		* BoltDB
	* Create SQL Schema (DDL) from JSON Configuration.
	* Create Golang ORM packages for RDBMS Transactions & Queries.

----------

* Built in JS Web Frameworks & CSS:
	* Angular 2.0
	* Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2
	* Font-Awesome 4.5
	* Jquery 2.2.2
	* Jquery-ui 1.11.4
	* Jquery-mobile-1.4.5
	

----------

* Future Database Support:
	* Posgres
	* NOSQL (MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, ...?)
	* 

----------
## Getting Started ##

### Install Golang 1.6 or greater and setup your GOPATH ###
[Windows Golang Setup](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/12/easy-go-programming-setup-for-windows/ "Windows Golang Setup")

[Linux & MAC Setup](https://golang.org/doc/install/ "Linux & MAC Setup")

### Set Your GOPATH to your Go Workspace

### Add to your Operating Systems Path the GOPATH/bin directory.


### Get GoCore
1.  To start a new project with GoCore run the following steps in a new console window.

	`go get github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/...`

NOTE:  You will see an output message (no buildable Go source files in ....  Please disregaurd.

2.  GoCore comes with a getCore package which can be used to get all external dependencies and custom files as well as example applications.

	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/getCore`

Then run

    getCore


By default getCore.go will pull down the latest master repository for Dependencies.  However, you can pass in the release version number to pull down a specific release.  If a specific release is not available then master will always default.

	getCore 1.0.0

###Build GoCore

1.  A sample project is available to build a GoCore project.

	`go get github.com/DanielRenne/GoCoreHelloWorld`

2.  Start by installing the buildHelloWorld package.
  
	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCoreHelloWorld/buildHelloWorld`

Then run

	buildHelloWorld

GoCore has built in functions to read json configuration files to generate SQL Tables, indexes, primary & foreign keys, NOSQL Collections & Buckets, auto-generated Golang model code files, auto-generated REST web api code files, and swagger.io schema files application.  See [BuildCore Readme](https://github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/blob/master/buildCore/README.md) for details.

###Run GoCore

1.  Run the following to install the GoCore runtime.

	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCoreHelloWorld`

Then run

	GoCoreHelloWorld

Open a web browser to:  [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1)

#### How to build your own web project in GoCore

See [Application Settings](https://github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/blob/master/doc/Application_Settings.md) within docs for information on how to setup your own custom application for GoCore.  Alternatively you can review GoCoreHelloWorld.


## IMPORTANT NOTE for HTTPS (TLS) Security
GoCore comes default with an open ssl generated Cert and PEM files that are **NOT** secret as they are available via the open source repository.  Make sure you replace both these files located in the `keys` directory.  To do this we recommend in Linux running the following command and copying the output files to the `keys` directory.  Alternatively cert and pem files generated by a valid Certificate Authority like GoDaddy or Verisign when you reach production with an online domain.

	openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

NOTE:  We also recommend **NOT** to store your secret key files in source control.  We recommend ignoring the keys directory for source control.

NOTE:  key files are ingored when running `getCore` as to not overwrite your keys.

## Building a Database Model with SQLite3

####NOTE: Because SQLite3 requires gcc externally we separated the driver for compiling reasons.  Windows users we recommend installing gcc as a prerequisite for the sqlite3 golang module to compile via [tdb-gcc](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download).  Be sure to install 64 bit for 64 bit machines. 

####More SQLite tools to verify your data in Windows [SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/)

To create a SQLite3 Database schema and model package for your application run the following:

	go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/buildCoreLite

Then run

	buildCoreLite
