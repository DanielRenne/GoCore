# GoCore

A Golang solution for building a full stack web application.

## Goals of the Project ##

Provide developers open source Golang tools and provide a complete project example/template for learning and implementing Golang technology.  Below are some targeted goals:

* Http & Https Redirection & HTTP 2.0 with Golang 1.6 and [gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* Extension packages for common functions including:
	* File IO Management & Manipulation
	* Zip File Compression & Decompression 

----------

* Database extensions and drivers for the following:
	* Supported databases:
		* SQLite3
		* MySQL
		* Microsoft SQLServer
		* BoltDB
	* Create SQL Schema (DDL) from JSON Configuration.
	* Create Golang ORM packages for RDBMS Transactions & Queries.

----------

* Built in JS Web Frameworks & CSS:
	* Angular 2.0
	* Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.2
	* Font-Awesome 4.5
	* Jquery 2.2.2
	* Jquery-ui 1.11.4
	* Jquery-mobile-1.4.5
	

----------

* Future Database Support:
	* Posgres
	* NOSQL (MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, ...?)
	* 

----------
## Getting Started ##

### Install Golang 1.6 and setup your GOPATH ###
[Windows Golang Setup](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/12/easy-go-programming-setup-for-windows/ "Windows Golang Setup")

[Linux & MAC Setup](https://golang.org/doc/install/ "Linux & MAC Setup")

### Set Your GOPATH to your Go Workspace

### Add to your Operating Systems Path the GOPATH/bin directory.


### Get GoCore
1.  To start a new project with GoCore run the following steps in a new console window.

	`go get github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/...`

2.  GoCore comes with a getCore package which can be used to get all external dependencies and custom files as well as example applications.

	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/getCore`

Then run

    getCore


By default getCore.go will pull down the latest master repository for Dependencies.  However, you can pass in the release version number to pull down a specific release.  If a specific release is not available then master will always default.

	getCore 1.0.0

###Build GoCore

1.  By default GoCore is set to build a helloWorld sample project.  Start by installing buildCore package.
  
	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/buildCore`

Then run

	buildCore

GoCore has built in functions to read json configuration files to generate SQL Tables, indexes, primary & foreign keys, NOSQL Collections & Buckets, auto-generated Golang model code files, auto-generated REST web api code files, and swagger.io schema files application.  See [BuildCore Readme](https://github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/blob/master/doc/NOSQL_Schema_Model.md) for details.

###Run GoCore

1.  Run the following to install the GoCore runtime.

	`go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/runCore`

Then run

	runCore

Open a web browser to:  [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1)

#### How to build your own web project in GoCore

GoCore has a main web configuration file called `webConfig.json` located in the main directory.

There you will see an application object.  The domain, httpPort, and httpsPort is used for your application to run on.  The name field is used to match database connections and generate Database files, schema, and a Golang model package.

GoCore has a 2nd file to compile the proper application located at:

	\src\github.com\DanielRenne\GoCore\core\app\app.go

This file is where you point your custom project files to launch.  The sample project launches helloWorld.  You will want to change this to your src files in the manner you see fit. 

NOTE:  Both webConfig.json and app.go files are ignored when running `getCore` as to not overwrite your configurations.

## IMPORTANT NOTE for HTTPS (TLS) Security
GoCore comes default with an open ssl generated Cert and PEM files that are **NOT** secret as they are available via the open source repository.  Make sure you replace both these files located in the `keys` directory.  To do this we recommend in Linux running the following command and copying the output files to the `keys` directory.  Alternatively cert and pem files generated by a valid Certificate Authority like GoDaddy or Verisign when you reach production with an online domain.

	openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

NOTE:  We also recommend **NOT** to store your secret key files in source control.  We recommend ignoring the keys directory for source control.

NOTE:  key files are ingored when running `getCore` as to not overwrite your keys.

## Building a Database Model with SQLite3

####NOTE: Because SQLite3 requires gcc externally we separated the driver for compiling reasons.  Windows users we recommend installing gcc as a prerequisite for the sqlite3 golang module to compile via [tdb-gcc](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download).  Be sure to install 64 bit for 64 bit machines. 

####More SQLite tools to verify your data in Windows [SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/)

To create a SQLite3 Database schema and model package for your application run the following:

	go install github.com/DanielRenne/GoCore/buildCoreLite

Then run

	buildCoreLite
